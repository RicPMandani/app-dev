My favorite movie as of now is
# Rogue One: A Star Wars Story

> Former scientist Galen Erso lives on a farm with his wife and young daughter, Jyn. His peaceful existence comes crashing down when the evil Orson Krennic takes him away from his beloved family. Many years later, Galen becomes the Empire's lead engineer for the most powerful weapon in the galaxy, the Death Star. Knowing that her father holds the key to its destruction, Jyn joins forces with a spy and other resistance fighters to steal the space station's plans for the Rebel Alliance.

What I really like about this movie is that it's largely different from the main Star Wars movie. The main characters don't have space wizard plot armor or most of it is grounded. It also features one of the best droids in the series, *K-2SO* [^1]. The movie also has one of my favorite space battle scenes, which is the Battle over Scarif, which other Star Wars in the sequel trilogy failed to have a engaging space battle. The other reason that I like about the movie is how it portrayed the Empire's stormtroopers as some incompetent soldiers who can't aim, and that they portrayed a variant of stormtroopers called the Death Troopers [^2]

[^1]: A reprogrammed Imperial Security Droid
[^2]: An elite stormtrooper variant specializing in stealth and espionage, often tasked around protecting high value personnel
